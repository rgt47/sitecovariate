  abstract = {Baseline imbalance in covariates associated with the primary outcome in clinical trials leads to bias in the reporting of results. Standard practice is to mitigate that bias by stratifying by those covariates in the randomization. Additionally, for continuously valued outcome variables, precision of estimates can be (and should be) improved by controlling for those covariates in analysis. Continuously valued covariates are commonly thresholded for the purpose of performing stratified randomization, with participants being allocated to arms such that balance between arms is achieved within each stratum. Often the thresholding consists of a simple dichotomization. For simplicity, it is also common practice to dichotomize the covariate when controlling for it at the analysis stage. This latter dichotomization is unnecessary, and has been shown in the literature to result in a loss of precision when compared with controlling for the covariate in its raw, continuous form. Analytic approaches to quantifying the magnitude of the loss of precision are generally confined to the most convenient case of a normally distributed covariate. This work generalises earlier findings, examining the effect on treatment effect estimation of dichotomizing skew-normal covariates, which are characteristic of a far wider range of real-world scenarios than their normal equivalents.},

  abstract = {Many clinical trials restrict randomisation using stratified blocks or minimisation to balance prognostic factors across treatment groups. It is widely acknowledged in the statistical literature that the subsequent analysis should reflect the design of the study, and any stratification or minimisation variables should be adjusted for in the analysis. However, a review of recent general medical literature showed only 14 of 41 eligible studies reported adjusting their primary analysis for stratification or minimisation variables. We show that balancing treatment groups using stratification leads to correlation between the treatment groups. If this correlation is ignored and an unadjusted analysis is performed, standard errors for the treatment effect will be biased upwards, resulting in 95\% confidence intervals that are too wide, type I error rates that are too low and a reduction in power. Conversely, an adjusted analysis will give valid inference. We explore the extent of this issue using simulation for continuous, binary and time-to-event outcomes where treatment is allocated using stratified block randomisation or minimisation.

The trial was expertly designed with a large patient population and, although superiority of narrow band imaging could not be proven, has important implications for further research on this topic. However, a significant issue concerning the analyses attracted our interest and we would like to comment on it. The primary outcome, the difference in proportion of patients in whom early gastric cancer was diagnosed, failed to reach statistical significance (p=0.412). This difference in proportions was tested for significance using Fisher's exact test. This might not have been the proper method for analysis, as patients in the study were randomised using minimisation with a random component, stratified by institution, age and indication of endoscopy. Imbalance of risk factors between treatment and control arms can occur by chance \ldots},

  abstract = {``Covariate adjustment'' in the randomized trial context refers to an estimator of the average treatment effect that adjusts for chance imbalances between study arms in baseline variables (called ``covariates''). The baseline variables could include, for example, age, sex, disease severity, and biomarkers. According to two surveys of clinical trial reports, there is confusion about the statistical properties of covariate adjustment. We focus on the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) estimator, which involves fitting a linear model for the outcome given the treatment arm and baseline variables, and trials that use simple randomization with equal probability of assignment to treatment and control. We prove the following new (to the best of our knowledge) robustness property of ANCOVA to arbitrary model misspecification: Not only is the ANCOVA point estimate consistent (as proved by Yang and Tsiatis, 2001) but so is its standard error. This implies that confidence intervals and hypothesis tests conducted as if the linear model were correct are still asymptotically valid even when the linear model is arbitrarily misspecified, for example, when the baseline variables are nonlinearly related to the outcome or there is treatment effect heterogeneity. We also give a simple, robust formula for the variance reduction (equivalently, sample size reduction) from using ANCOVA. By reanalyzing completed randomized trials for mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, and depression, we demonstrate how ANCOVA can achieve variance reductions of 4 to 32\%.},
